# üíé Sapphire Notes

###### Prettier  than Notepad and snappier than Electron alternatives.

## What is it?

A cross-platform desktop application for managing notes built with [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/).

### Features

Create and manage textual notes.

All notes are stored as simple .txt files. So if you decide to stop using the app you'll still have your notes in a format that you can transfer anywhere.

The application saves automatically in frequent intervals and also when closed, so you won't have to do Ctrl/Command+S (even though you may be compelled to).

You can choose where your notes are stored. If you want them to be backed up you can simply choose your OneDrive or DropBox folder as the storage location and voil√†, cloud backup! üåê
